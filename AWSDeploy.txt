The app is now deployed in AWS 

The docker images are pushed to the ECR 
using these commands from the terminal : https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories?region=us-east-1

Then cd back to root folder csproject
ensure you have a running instance of ec2 with permission to read the registry 

Then you can ssh into the ec2 instance using ssh -i "name.pem" ec2-user@"publicIP"
ensure the pem file you get when you make the ecs2 instance is in the root folder(the one you should've cd to)
fill in the pem file name and get your publicIP address from the EC2 page 

Now that you are in EC2 you need to install and update docker

sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install -y docker
sudo service docker start
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user # add to docker users 

exit ec2 instance
ssh back in and log in again 

docker pull 
docker run 

-------------------------------
we set the app to autorun when the ec2 instance starts

start the instance in ec2 dashboard
you need to ssh into a new instance with different IP 
We access the app at a different ip address. 



"Smooth Operator" Workflow to add new image:
Laptop: build -> tag -> push

EC2: docker pull (Gets the new files)

EC2: docker rm -f my-app (Kills the old version)

EC2: docker run ... --restart always (Starts the new version)
