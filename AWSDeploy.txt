The app is now deployed in AWS 

The docker images are pushed to the ECR 
using these commands from the terminal : https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories?region=us-east-1

Then cd back to root folder csproject
ensure you have a running instance of ec2 with permission to read the registry 

Then you can ssh into the ec2 instance using ssh -i "name.pem" ec2-user@"publicIP"
ensure the pem file you get when you make the ecs2 instance is in the root folder(the one you should've cd to)
fill in the pem file name and get your publicIP address from the EC2 page 

Now that you are in EC2 you need to install and update docker
# Update the package manager
sudo dnf update -y


sudo dnf install -y docker

# Start the Docker service
sudo service docker start

# (Optional) Make Docker start automatically if the server reboots
sudo systemctl enable docker

sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user # add to docker users 

now use exit to leave the ec2 instance
Then we can ssh back in and log in again 

docker pull 
docker run
